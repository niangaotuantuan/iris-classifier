iris-classifier
===============

classify iris data using CART and Neural Networks

## Data
Iris Data Set,
you can find the data set used in this project in \data.
Also, you can find more information on [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) and [other sites](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris).


## Model
In this project, I used two classification models.
One is CART, a version of Decision Tree. The other one is Neural Network, which will cost lots of memory and time to train.
You can find them in \src.


## Parameter for Neural Network 
I haven't implement the parameter tuning in Neural Network methods.
And the parameter initialization is in \src\Neural Network\readme.txt
